Acknowledgments
---------------------
We express my deep gratitude to the Mr. Sebastián Ramírez aka tiangolo_ for his work on creating a wonderful framework FastAPI. A lot of the code for this project was taken from his full-stack-fastapi-postgresql_ repository.
It seemed a bit heavy to me, so we created my own lightweight version. Hope you enjoy it :)

Also I'd like to say Thank you to all of the creators of Cookiecutter-Django_.
This is a very cool project with the same idea, but under the Django framework.

We admire the work they have done!

Usage
------

First, get Cookiecutter. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip3 install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/bigEvilBanana/cookiecutter-fastapi

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a FastAPI project will be created for you.
